// The above program compiles and runs successfully. This proves that interface overcomes the problem of multiple
// inheritance partially. Here the method display() is common to both the interfaces A and B. The class C implements
// both the interfaces and overrides the method display(). The method display() is called using the object of class C,
// from the superclass reference variable of type A or B. Why? Because the compiler doesn't know which display()
// method to call. So, it calls the display() method of the superclass reference variable. This is called dynamic
// method dispatch. This is how interface overcomes the problem of multiple inheritance partially.
